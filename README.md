# hackaton

Hi! 
To prepare the environment, you need to install mysql and php 7.1.

The script to create the database could be found in hackaton/db/databaseScript.sql.

You can use the built-in PHP server too... `php -S localhost:80 -t /public` in the hackaton folder!
 
Any question, please send me an email thiagofalencar@gmail.com.
